# Re-Birth


       The saddest part is that some individuals in the world already know when they are going to pass away (for instance, cancer sufferers, etc.), and they are unable to change it. They remain miserable for the rest of their lives, as do those around them. Re-BirthÂ brings them some measure of solace. If a patient strikes a deal with us, we can travel with him or her for approximately a week to gather his or her voice recordings, photos, and other data toÂ develop a virtual human cloneÂ identical to the original. So that at least knowing that his or her loved ones are not alone would allow him or her to pass away gently.
